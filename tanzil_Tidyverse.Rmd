I was looking for a simple dataset with count data for chess players transfer to the U.S.

```{r}

library(readr)

# Option 1: Double backslashes
chess_df <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanzil64/Tanzil_Tidyverse/refs/heads/main/chess_transfers.csv')

# Preview the data
#glimpse(chess_df)
```
```{r}
str(chess_df)
```

```{r}
# Clean column names
chess_df <- chess_df %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

# View cleaned column names
names(chess_df)
```

```{r}
# Extract year from date
chess_df <- chess_df %>%
  mutate(
    parsed_date = parse_date_time(transfer_date, orders = c("ymd", "dmy", "mdy")),
    transfer_year = year(parsed_date)
  )

# Count transfers per year
transfers_per_year <- chess_df %>%
  count(transfer_year)

chess_df <- chess_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(form_fed) & !is.na(form_fed))
```
```{r}
str(chess_df)
```
## Visualization: Transfers Over Time
```{r}
ggplot(transfers_per_year, aes(x = transfer_year, y = n)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "darkred", size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Chess Player Transfers Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Transfers") +
  theme_minimal()

```



##  Most Active Federations
```{r}
# Count transfers out by 'form_fed' and select top 10
top_federations <- chess_df %>%
  count(form_fed, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10)

ggplot(top_federations, aes(x = reorder(form_fed, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Federations by Transfers Out",
       x = "From Federation",
       y = "Number of Transfers") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 12)
  )


```
## Sorting by Number of Transfers
```{r}
chess_df %>% 
  count(form_fed) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(form_fed, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Destination Federation", 
       y = "Number of Transfers", 
       caption = "Data: FIDE Federation Transfers") +
  coord_flip()
```
## Grouping Less Frequent Federations
```{r}
top_feds <- chess_df %>% 
  count(form_fed) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 5) %>% 
  pull(form_fed)

chess_df %>% 
  count(form_fed) %>% 
  mutate(form_fed = fct_other(form_fed, keep = top_feds, other_level = "Other Federations")) %>% 
  group_by(form_fed) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(form_fed, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Destination Federation", 
       y = "Number of Transfers", 
       caption = "Data: FIDE Federation Transfers") +
  coord_flip()
```

```{r}
chess_df %>% 
  count(form_fed) %>% 
  mutate(form_fed = fct_other(form_fed, keep = top_feds, other_level = "Other Federations")) %>% 
  group_by(form_fed) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(form_fed, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Destination Federation", 
       y = "Number of Transfers", 
       title = "Top Chess Federation Transfer Destinations",
       subtitle = paste0(min(chess_df$transfer_year), "-", max(chess_df$transfer_year)),
       caption = "Data: FIDE Federation Transfers") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, color = "blue"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, color = "gold")) +
  coord_flip()
```
